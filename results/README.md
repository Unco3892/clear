The results are organized as follows:
- Variant (a) is `qPCS_all_10seeds_all`
- Variant (b) is `qPCS_qxgb_10seeds_qxgb`
- Variant (c) is `PCS_all_10seeds_qrf`. 
- We have an alternative to variant c, where we just run QXGB instead of QRF in `PCS_all_10seeds_qxgb`, but after studying the results, QRF was slightly better, therefore we have only retained that at the end.
